Day 100 coding Statement : 

You have prepared four problems. The difficulty levels of the problems are A1?,A2?,A3?,A4? respectively. A problem set comprises at least two problems and no two problems in a problem set should have the same difficulty level. A problem can belong to at most one problem set. Find the maximum number of problem sets you can create using the four problems.
