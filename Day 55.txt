Day 55 coding Statement:
Given 2 integer arrays X and Y of same size. Consider both arrays as vectors and print the sum of maximum scalar product (Dot product) of 2 vectors.

size = int(input("Enter size of arrays: "))

X = []
# enter elements into first array
for i in range(size):
    X.append(int(input()))

Y = []
# enter elements into second array
for i in range(size):
    Y.append(int(input()))
    
dot_product = 0

for i in range(size):
    dot_product = dot_product + (X[i] * Y[i])
    
# display the Fot Product
print(dot_product)
