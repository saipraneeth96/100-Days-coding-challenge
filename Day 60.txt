Day 60 coding Statement : Good Weather

The weather report of Magicland is Good if the number of sunny days in a week is strictly greater than the number of rainy days.

Given 7 integers A1,A2,A3,A4,A5,A6,A7 where Ai=1 denotes that the ith day of week in Magicland is a sunny day, Ai=0 denotes that the ith day in Magicland is a rainy day. Determine if the weather report of Magicland is Good or not.

SOLUTION:

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):
    # input climate type  in each day of the week
    a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7 = map(int, input().split())
    
    count_of_ones = 0
    for i in [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7]:
        if i == 1:
            count_of_ones += 1
    count_of_zeros = 7 - count_of_ones
    
    if count_of_ones > count_of_zeros:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
