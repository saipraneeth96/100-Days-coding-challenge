Day 62 coding Statement : Gold Mining

Anusree has decided to go to a gold mine along with N of his friends (thus, total N+1 people including Anusree go to the gold mine).

The gold mine contains a total of X kg of gold. Every person has the capacity of carrying up atmost Y kg of gold.

Will Anusree and his friends together be able to carry up all the gold from the gold mine assuming that they can go to the mine exactly once.

SOLUTION:

# enter number of testcases
t = int(input())

for i in range(t):
    # n = number of friends
    # x = kgs of gold
    # y = kgs of gold each person can carry
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    
    # total gold they can carry
    total = (n+1) * y
    
    if total >= x:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
