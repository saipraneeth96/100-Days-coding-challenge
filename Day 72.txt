Day 72 coding Statement:
In this problem, you will have to implement a simple editor. The editor maintains the content of a string S and have two following functions:

# Function to process queries
def process_queries(queries):
    # Initialize the string S
    S = ""
    
    # Results for '? i len' queries
    results = []

    # Process each query
    for query in queries:
        parts = query.split()
        
        if parts[0] == '+':
            # Extract the parameters for the `+` query
            i = int(parts[1])  # Position
            x = parts[2]       # String to insert
            
            # Insert x at the i-th position (1-indexed)
            S = S[:i] + x + S[i:]
        
        elif parts[0] == '?':
            # Extract the parameters for the `?` query
            i = int(parts[1])  # Start position
            length = int(parts[2])  # Length of the substring
            
            # Extract the substring (1-indexed)
            result = S[i-1:i-1+length]
            results.append(result)

    return results



# Input reading
Q = int(input())
queries = [input().strip() for i in range(Q)]

# Process queries and output results
results = process_queries(queries)
for res in results:
    print(res)
