Day 81 coding Statement : 

You have a binary string S of length N. In one operation you can select a substring of S and reverse it. For example, on reversing the substring [2,4]S[2,4] for S=11000, we change 11000â†’10010.

Find the minimum number of operations required to sort this binary string.
It can be proven that the string can always be sorted using the above operation finite number of times.

def minOperations(n, s):
    
    group_zeros = group_ones = 0
    # Track the previous character to detect transitions
    prev_char = ''
    
    # Count the number of transitions from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0'
    transitions = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:  # Transition detected
            transitions += 1

    # Minimum operations required to sort the string
    # Each transition marks a boundary between groups of 0s and 1s.
    # Number of groups = transitions + 1
    # To sort the binary string, the minimum number of operations
    # is the smaller of the number of '0' groups and '1' groups.
    operations = (transitions + 1) // 2
    
    # Minimum operations required to sort        
    return operations


# input number of test cases
t = int(input())

for i in range(t):
    # input length of binary string
    N = int(input())
    
    # input the binary string
    S = input()
    
    result = minOperations(N, S)
    
    # display the output
    print(result)
