Day 82 coding Statement : 

You are given N binary strings of length N each. You need to find a binary string of length N which is different from all of the given strings.



def binaryString(n, strings):
    # list to store binary strings of length N that can be constructed and are not in input
    missedOut = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        if strings[i][i] == '0':
            missedOut.append('1')
        else:
            missedOut.append('0')
            
    return missedOut        

# input numbner of test cases
t = int(input())

for i in range(t):
    # input N binary string of length N
    N = int(input())
    
    # input strings of length N into an lsit
    strings = []
    
    for j in range(N):
        strings.append(input())
        
    results = binaryString(N, strings)
    
    # display the output
    print(''.join(results))
