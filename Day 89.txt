Day 89 coding Statement : 

You are given N integers. In each step you can choose some K of the remaining numbers and delete them, if the following condition holds: Let the K numbers you've chosen be a1, a2, a3, ..., aK in sorted order. Then, for each i ≤ K - 1, ai+1 must be greater than or equal to ai * C.

You are asked to calculate the maximum number of steps you can possibly make.

def max_steps(N, K, C, nums):
    nums.sort()  # Sort the array
    steps = 0
    i = 0
        
    # Iterate through the array to form valid groups
    while i + K <= N:
        valid = True
        for j in range(1, K):
            if nums[i + j] < nums[i + j - 1] * C:
                valid = False
                break
            
        if valid:
            steps += 1
            i += K  # Skip K elements
        else:
            i += 1  # Move to the next starting element

    return steps


# Input count of test cases
T = int(input())

for i in range(T):
    N, K, C = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    answers = max_steps(N, K, C, nums)
    
    # display the result
    print(answers)
